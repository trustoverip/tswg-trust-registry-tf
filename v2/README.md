# Trust Registry Task Force

## Objective

The objective of the Trust Registry Task Force is to develop the `ToIP Trust Registry Protocol`.

The purpose of the `ToIP Trust Registry Protocol` is to support the
participation in a `trust community` and enable `trust tasks`.

A trust registry facilitates access to `authoritative sources` of information
needed to `perform trust tasks` and make `trust decisions` within the context of
a `governance framework(s)`.

## Target Audience

The audience for this specification is system architects, software developers,
and registry operators who wish to design and implement a trust registry â€” or
applications and systems that incorporate trust registry services.

This includes, but is not limited to:
