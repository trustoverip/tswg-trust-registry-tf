> DEPRECATED: This spec is deprecated. Please refer to [Trust Registry Query
> Protocol (TRQP)](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/tree/main) for the latest version of the spec.

## Objective

The objective of the Trust Registry Task Force is to develop the `ToIP Trust Registry Protocol` as a ToIP Layer 3 `trust task` protocol that enables
standardized interactions with a `trust registry`.

The purpose of a `trust registry` is to serve as an `authoritative source` for `governed information` about a `trust community`.
